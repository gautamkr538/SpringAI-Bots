Spring AI RAG Workflow

This repository contains a Spring Boot + Spring AI powered application that demonstrates Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for AI-driven features, including chatbots, blog generation, code assistance, weather integration, and multimedia services.

📌 Overview
This project integrates:
Spring AI for LLM-based interactions
Vector Database for semantic embeddings and similarity search
RESTful APIs to expose chatbot, weather, and content-generation features
External Services like OpenAI APIs, Selenium for data crawling, and external weather APIs
The following diagram provides a complete architecture flow:
